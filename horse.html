		Dear Sir/Madam, <br><br>

my name is Vladimir Stanković and I wish to apply for a position of Store Manager for Sinsay brand. <br> <br>
With my past few jobs I've gathered experience from data manegement and data entry to campaign management on public online forums and administration.<br><br> 
I'd especially like to point out my last job of Assistant to the Public enforcement agent where I started working as an administrator and IT support, and whithin just
a couple of months I was in charge of training new employees and trying to think of ideas on how we can we improve the workplace and work flow overall, taking care of the office inventory, printing out receipts, taking care of mail, writing reports at the end of the day and taking/receiving calls for whatever was needed.<br><br>
			 			 
I've always found satisfaction in problem solving, making things more efficient and overall have anything ran like a well oiled machine. Team player, always determined to finish any task as best as it can be done, welcoming critiques of any kind and always ready to learn new skills. Always been thinking systematically, loved mathematics, graphs and tables, hence my great interest in Data Management/Data entry, efficiency improvement and problem solving.<br><br>
			 
Competative by nature, consistent and always striving towards orderliness. <br><br>	
			 
			 
I appreciate your consideration, and look forward to hearing from you. <br><br><br><br>

Sincerely, <br>
Vladimir Stanković
