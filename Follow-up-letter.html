		Dear Sir/Madam, <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my name is Vladimir Stanković and I wish to apply for a position of Junior Technical Recruiter/Intern. <br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my past few jobs I've gathered experience from data manegement, data entry, server maintenance to campaign management on public online forums and administration.<br><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd especially like to point out my last job of Assistant to the Public enforcement agent where I started working as an administrator and IT support, and within just
a couple of months I was in charge of training new employees and trying to think of ideas on how we can we improve the workplace and work flow overall, taking care of the office inventory, printing out receipts, taking care of mail, writing reports at the end of the day and taking/receiving calls for whatever was needed. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Also at my current working position, I've went from salesman to being a PC service and maintenance person, and when's nothing to do at work, rather than sitting and staring at my phone, changing our current website that's we use to add some improvements through "inspect element" and sending suggestions to our current web developer.<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, I'm also working on my very own website (redirex.rs) which I use to practise and try out new things on and, hopefully, lauch it as my very own business in the future. As you're able to see, I like calm, clean and simplistic looking websites that go right to the point.	 
<br><br> 
			
			 			 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've always found satisfaction in problem solving, making things more efficient and overall have anything ran like a well oiled machine. Team player, always determined to finish any task as best as it can be done, welcoming critiques of any kind and always ready to learn new skills. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Always been thinking systematically, loved mathematics, graphs and tables, hence my great interest in Data Management, web design and development, efficiency, improvement and problem solving.<br><br>
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I'd be the right fit for this position. I love technology, internet, good presentation, getting to the point, simplicity, and amongst other things, efficiency. I'm not afraid, on the contrary, to be sitting on my computer for 12h a day (just like I was when I was first starting and learning the basics) trying to get things done as best as they can be done. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I'm always open to challenges and love solving problems, because that's just new knowledge and experience. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always in competition with myself and trying to improve with every new day, either by simply working on some code or watching videos and presentations on "tips and tricks" for coding. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I get into something, working 30-35 hours a week would be done in a day. Just like at this job, working alone is when I shine, not that I do not like working with someone butmost of the time they can't catch up and are just slowing me down, I'm know to talk fast, think fast and work fast.	 <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competative by nature, consistent and always striving towards orderliness and effectiveness. <br><br>	
			 
			 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you. <br><br><br><br>

Sincerely, <br>
Vladimir Stanković
