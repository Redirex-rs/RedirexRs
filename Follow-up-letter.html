		Dear Sir/Madam, <br><br>

My name is Vladimir Stanković and I wish to apply for a position of Tax Preparer Trainee at 1040 Abroad. <br> <br>

I have experiecne with Web Development, Administration and Data Management.Until recently I was working for Public Enforcement Officer/Agent (civil debt enforcement) without any prior law knowledge and in just a couple of months I took over training new employees, managing office web server, managing mail and managing office inventory on top of my primary job as an administrator. Because of my very competative nature, I'm trying to look at every task as a challenge, trying to finish it as fast as I can when I'm sure I've mastered that particular task. Just seeing the slightest of improvements after a  completed task brings me joy. <br><br> 

I've always found satisfaction in problem solving, hence my interest in cryptography and puzzles overall. Team player, always determined to finish any task as best as it can be done, welcoming critiques of any kind and always ready to learn new skills. Always been thinking systematically, loved mathematics, graphs and tables, hence my great interest in Data Management/Data enty and administration work overall. Currently doing data management for my mothers' catering business (honorary work). <br><br>

<u>US International Taxation:</u> <br>
I am familiar with outbound (US companies operating abroad as well) and inbound taxation (foreign companies operating in the US) and as well as rules and rights of the US government and taxation of such companies. That income is generally taxed where it is sourced with exceptions,etc.. I've found some great university lecture about U.S. International Tax Policy and also documents from the IRS website to broaden my knowledge about this topic.<br>
<br>
<u>Expectations related to potential engagement at 1040 Abroad:</u> <br>
My honest expectations would be to find myself in this area of work, to be given the opportunity to prove myself and contribute to further development and improvement of the companies efficiency as well. To be given a chance to learn and expand my knowledge for the future. Since in the near future I'd be most likely moving to Canada with my girlfriend, soon to be fiancé, I'd be more than happy to continue with this and excel further in this area of work. 
 <br><br>

I appreciate your consideration, and look forward to hearing from you. <br><br><br><br>

Yours sincerely, <br>

Vladimir Stanković
